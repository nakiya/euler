# euler
Some Project Euler problems solved in Clojure. Continuous from problem 23 onwards. Currently at 69.

(Everything in a single file because sometimes I used a windows machine where lein couldn't download dependencies and where I didn't have a proper IDE)

Clojure lends itself to this sort of problems and it's a joy to see the transformation of the problem data into the solution. Thread-last macro ftw!

## What I've learned so far
1. How to create pipelines which work on data. Or Conveyor belts.
2. How powerful `map`, `filter`, `reduce` functions are.
3. Playing with data and seeing the results make the problem-solving exercise faster and more fun. The REPL and an integrated editor are amazing here.
