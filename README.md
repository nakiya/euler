Solutions to problems #1 to #90 in Clojure.

Sometimes I used a windows machine where lein couldn't download dependencies (Because I was in a corporate network and firewall blocked me off) and where I don't have a proper IDE and tooling support. In order to minimize suffering, I kept everything in a single file.

Clojure lends itself to this sort of problems and it's a joy to see the transformation of the problem data into the solution. Thread-last macro ftw!

## What I've learned so far
1. How to create pipelines which work on data. This seems to me to be the most intuitive way to do things.
2. How powerful `map`, `filter`, `reduce` functions are.
3. Functional programming. How to practically do it.
4. Playing with data and seeing the results make the problem-solving exercise faster and more fun. The REPL and an integrated editor are amazing here. (Spacemacs + cider, and if on windows VSCode with Calva plugin)

This is way more fun than it has any right to be.
